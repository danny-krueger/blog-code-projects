    multiline.pattern: '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}'
    
    # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
    multiline.negate: true

    # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
    # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
    # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
